            <p>The <i>ap delete</i> command is used to delete a project or node from AP and ENM. It deletes all data generated by Auto Provisioning.</p>
            <p>During Node Integration if a node has never been successfully synchronized then ap delete will remove the Network Element created by Auto Provisioning.</p>
            <p>The following options are available:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Delete can be requested for a project using the <i>ap delete</i> command with the <i>-p</i> parameter.</li>
                    <li>Delete can be requested for a node using the <i>ap delete</i> command with the <i>-n</i> parameter.</li>
                    <li>Use the <i>-i</i> parameter to prevent the NetworkElement MO and security data from being deleted. For VNF nodes, the <i>-i</i> parameter also prevents the VNF from being deleted from the Cloud Infrastructure Domain.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>For more information on delete see <xref href="/overview/apoperations.xml#Delete" type="concept">Operations, Delete</xref></p>
            <p><b>Warning: </b>If the user wants to stop the migration before it is completed it is recommended to cancel the migration activity before deletion. Failure to cancel migration before deletion may result in the node being left in an inconsistent state.</p>
